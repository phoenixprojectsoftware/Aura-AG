// Aura for ZAMNHLMP Version Info
// If you're using Aura for your own mod, change the values for the zamnhlmp definers.

// These are in the order they appear in PrintVersion()
#define clientDate __TIMESTAMP__
#define auraVersion "v2.0"
#define zamnhlmpVersion "v2.6-PPT1"
#define Authors "The Phoenix Project Software"
#define auraCL "https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/Aura-CL"
#define auraSE "https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/Aura-SE"
#define zamnhlmpRepo "https://github.com/phoenixprojectsoftware/zamnhlmp"

// When I change the version number I will probably do Ctrl+Shift+H in Visual Studio and
// replace "old version" with "new version," you know what I mean. It's a really shitty
// way to do it, but I can't be bothered to program it to read the info from a text file.
// Lol.
